Using existing frameworks/APIs (IBM Qiskit) and writing our own Python code to explore quantum computing. 

# Repository Structure:
notes/--as the name implies, this directory will contain my notes, formatted as YAML and PDF documents
src/--root directory for code

# Additional Notes
As code is written, installation instructions will be added here. Python is required (>= 3.5), though additional components, including MS VC++, may be needed for Windows.
