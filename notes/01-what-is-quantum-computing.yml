This series:
  - starts as an investor's guide to quantum computing
  - however, code examples and some math explained for those who want a deeper dive

Introductory concepts:
  - Current computers use classical bits; quantum machines use qubits
  - What quantum interactions are there?
    - a superposition refers to a combination (sum) of quantum states:
      - do know that whenever a quantum system is measured, it will RANDOMLY RETURN a discrete output (e.g. 1 or 0)
      - for instance, a qubit may exist in a superposition; however, when it is measured, it will randomly represent a 1 or 0
    - two entangled quantum particles are "linked together":
      - when the state of one particle is measured, it will behave randomly
      - however, its behavior indicates the measured behavior of the other particle 
      - this rule applies regardless of the distance between the entangled particles
      - a key rule for quantum computation
    - quantum interference: TODO

Fields revolutionized by Quantum Computing: TODO
