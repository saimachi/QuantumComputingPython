This series:
  - starts as an investor's guide to quantum computing
  - however, code examples and some math explained for those who want a deeper dive

Introductory concepts:
  - Current computers use classical bits; quantum machines use qubits
  - What quantum interactions are there?
    - a superposition refers to a combination (sum) of quantum states:
      - do know that whenever a quantum system is measured, it will RANDOMLY RETURN a discrete output (e.g. 1 or 0)
      - for instance, a qubit may exist in a superposition; however, when it is measured, it will randomly represent a 1 or 0
    - two entangled quantum particles are "linked together":
      - when the state of one particle is measured, it will behave randomly
      - however, its behavior indicates the measured behavior of the other particle 
      - this rule applies regardless of the distance between the entangled particles
      - a key rule for quantum computation
    - quantum interference can be understood as similar to wave interference:
      - when two waves are in phase, their amplitudes add
      - when they are not in phase, their amplitudes cancel

Fields revolutionized by Quantum Computing: 
  - quantum physics:
    - in 1981, Richard Feynman mentioned humanity's inability to model quantum systems for experimentation
    - so he proposed a quantum machine, which wouldn't need to store the tremendous number of variables in limited memory
    - there are practical applications; consider chemistry, with its atomic interactions
  - retrieval in large amounts of data:
    - phone book example:
      - phone book contains 1,000,000 records
      - each entry is indexed by NAME--not phone number
      - so, possibly, we may need to sift through all 1,000,000 records to find the name associated with a particular number
      - in 1996, Bell Labs engineers proved that this process could be reduced to 1,000 steps max on a quantum machine
        - pre-teach extension: Grover's algorithm for inverting a function
  - What other problems are you excited to solve with quantum computing?
