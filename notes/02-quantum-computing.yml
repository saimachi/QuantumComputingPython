Representing/Processing Qubits: please see the LaTeX PDF document
  - vector representation of qubits:
    - 
  - quantum algorithms are implemented with quantum gates, not unlike logic gates in classical computing
  - Hadamard Gate:
    - this gate takes a qubit in the '0' state and returns a qubit in superposition of both 0 and 1
    - there is a very interesting property about this gate:
      - obviously, when the output qubit is measured, it will return 0 OR 1--NOT A SUPERPOSITION
      - however, the probabilities of measuring a 0 or measuring a 1 are equal
